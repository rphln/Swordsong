# Mechanics

## Preparation (Duels)

A team must be made before a match and is composed of three characters
from the same party plus up to two characters from any other parties.

At the start of a match, the player will go through a number of
preparation steps.

1.  The player must choose any three characters in their team to field
    during the selection step of the match.
    
    During this step, players can see which characters are part of their
    opponent’s team, but not which are going to be fielded.

2.  The player must decide the position of the characters that are
    fielded during the placement step of the match.
    
    During this step, players can see which characters are fielded by
    the opponent, but not their positions.

3.  The player must choose whether to keep or replace each of the three
    cards in their starting hand. The cards chosen for replacement will
    be shuffled back into the deck before the new cards are drawn.
    
    During this step, players can see the positions of all of their
    opponent’s characters.

## Preparation (Raids)

The preparation for raids is the same as for duels, except in that up to
five characters can be fielded.

## Combat

  - Once per turn, a character can walk to any tile within their speed
    score in distance.

  - Once per turn, a character can perform a basic attack against any
    opponent within their reach.

  - Once per turn, a character can perform a counter-attack when an
    opponent within their reach attacks them.

  - Each character receives an attack action and a movement action
    during each turn.

  - Upon being attacked, the defender will take damage equal to the
    power of the attacker.

  - A character whose damage taken surpasses their armor will be removed
    from the match as fainted.

## Action points

  - Each player starts with zero action points.

  - A player can have up to 10 action points.

  - A player will have their maximum action points increased by one at
    the beginning of each of their turns.

  - A player will have their action points fully restored at the
    beginning of each of their turns.

  - Action points are used exclusively for using skill cards.

## Cards

  - Each character has four copies of their class skill card.

  - Each character has three copies of each of their unique skill cards.

  - A deck is made by shuffling the card pools of the characters fielded
    in a match.

  - A player can freely use skill cards during their turns for as long
    as they have enough action points to do so.

  - A player will draw a card from their deck at the beginning of each
    of their turns.

  - A player can have up to 7 cards in their hand at time. Cards drawn
    while their hand is full are discarded.

## Defeat

  - A player whose all characters they control are fainted will lose the
    match.

  - A player will lose the match upon trying to draw from an empty deck.

  - A player can also choose to forfeit the match at any time.

## Talents

Each character has a talent – a passive ability that activates under
certain circumstances.

  - Prologue triggers as the character enters the match for the first
    time.

  - Epilogue triggers as the character leaves the match for the first
    time.

  - Interlude triggers as the character starts their turn. This category
    of talents is generally reserved for special enemies or bosses.

## Effects

Effects modify the behaviour of a character, lasting until some
condition is met. Applying the same effect multiple times does nothing.

| Name       | Effect                                                                                                      |

A character class determines what they can do and how they fare in
combat.

  - Ranged characters can only target units that are exactly two tiles
    away from them. They can move up to three tiles per turn.

    away from them. They can move up to five tiles per turn.
