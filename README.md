A mishmash of card games and tactical RPGs.

The player assumes the role of a fate weaver, one who manipulates the
course of lives of mortals. They watch over a team of heroes as they
fight through duels and raids.

The game is a turn-based, tactical RPG with elements from card games.
The player will control a team of characters through a hexagonal grid,
battling against other teams (in duels) or against bosses (in raids).

It borrows ideas from card games in that the charactersâ€™ skills are
presented in the form of cards, drawn from a deck and which can be used
by spending action points. Furthermore, the combat mostly follows the
simplified rules common in card games, in which each character only has
a power and a armor score.

By doing so, it is expected that having randomized opportunities with
fixed outcomes (as opposed of fixed opportunities with randomized
outcomes) will result in a more interesting experience by giving the
player agency while still preventing each match from being exactly the
same.
