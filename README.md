# Introduction

A mishmash of card games and tactical RPGs, in which the player assumes
the role of an expedition leader and strategist.

The game is a turn-based, tactical RPG with elements from card games.
The player will control a team of characters through a hexagonal grid,
battling against other teams (in duels) or against bosses (in raids).

It borrows ideas from card games in that the characters’ skills are
presented in the form of cards, drawn from a deck and which can be used
by spending action points. Furthermore, the combat mostly follows the
simplified rules common in card games, in which each character only has
a power and a armor score.

By doing so, it is expected that having randomized opportunities with
fixed outcomes (as opposed of fixed opportunities with randomized
outcomes) will result in a more interesting experience by giving the
player agency while still preventing each match from being exactly the
same.

Conceptually, cards represent the “thought” of doing something, while
action points represent the “opportunity” to actually do so.
