# The Ivory Tower

The so-called paradise of researchers. Originally built as a research
camp to study a meteor overflowing in mana, they attracted mages and
scholars from all around, establishing their influence within Norden
after only a couple of decades.

Among their ranks, this particular group partakes in the developments of
techniques and technologies for magical firearms by employing them in
practical combat, being also involved in the defences of the Tower.
